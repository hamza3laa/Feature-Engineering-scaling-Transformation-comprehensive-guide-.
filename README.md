# Feature-Engineering-scaling-Transformation-comprehensive-guide-
The machine learning algorithm works on numbers and does not know what that number represents. A weight of 10 grams and a price of 10 dollars represents completely two different things — which is a no brainer for humans, but for a model as a feature, it treats both as same. Suppose we have two features of weight and price, as in the below table. The “Weight” cannot have a meaningful comparison with the “Price.” So the assumption algorithm makes that since “Weight” > “Price,” thus “Weight,” is more important than “Price.”.
